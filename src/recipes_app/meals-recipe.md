    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    * 1 tablespoon butter

* **For the Lemon-Dill Sauce:**
    * 1/4 cup dry white wine (optional, can substitute with chicken broth)
    * 2 tablespoons lemon juice
    * 2 tablespoons butter
    * 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill

* **For the Asparagus:**

    * 1 tablespoon olive oil
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 1/4 teaspoon black pepper


**Equipment:**
* Large skillet
* Baking sheet
* Small saucepan


**Instructions**

**Get started:**

1. Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C).


**Prepare the Asparagus:**

1. Toss asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper on a baking sheet.
2. Roast for 12-15 minutes, or until tender-crisp.


**Cook the Salmon:**

1. Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Add salmon fillets, skin-side down (if using skin-on), and cook for 4-5 minutes, until skin is crispy and golden brown.
4. Flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.  Adjust cooking time based on thickness of fillets.  Internal temperature should reach 145째F (63째C).
5. Remove salmon from skillet and set aside.


**Make the Lemon-Dill Sauce:**

1. In the same skillet, add white wine (or broth) and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
2. Reduce heat to low and stir in lemon juice, butter, and dill.
3. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until sauce slightly thickens.


**Assemble and Serve:**

1. Spoon lemon-dill sauce over the salmon fillets.
2. Serve immediately with roasted asparagus.


**Tips and Variations:**

* For extra flavor, marinate the salmon in a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and dill for 30 minutes before cooking.
* Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the lemon-dill sauce for a touch of heat.
* Substitute other vegetables for the asparagus, such as broccoli, green beans, or Brussels sprouts.
* Serve with a side of quinoa or rice for a more complete meal.
