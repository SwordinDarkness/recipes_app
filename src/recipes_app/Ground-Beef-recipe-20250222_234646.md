This recipe elevates humble ground beef into a rich and satisfying masterpiece, perfect for a cozy night in or a special occasion.


**Yields:** 6 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 1 hour 30 minutes


**Ingredients:**

* **For the Bourguignon:**
    * 1 lb ground beef
    * 1 large onion, finely chopped
    * 2 carrots, finely chopped
    * 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
    * 3 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 cup dry red wine (Burgundy is traditional, but a Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot works well)
    * 1 cup beef broth
    * 1 tbsp tomato paste
    * 1 tsp dried thyme
    * 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
    * 1 bay leaf
    * 1 lb cremini mushrooms, sliced
    * 1 tbsp olive oil
    * Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    * 1 tbsp all-purpose flour (optional, for thickening)

* **For the Creamy Polenta:**
    * 4 cups water
    * 1 tsp salt
    * 1 cup coarse polenta (cornmeal)
    * 1/2 cup heavy cream
    * 2 tbsp butter
    * Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, to taste


**Instructions:**

**1. Prepare the Bourguignon:**

* Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Drain off any excess fat.
* Add onion, carrots, and celery to the pot and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.  Stir in garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
* Stir in tomato paste, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
* Pour in red wine and beef broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
* Add sliced mushrooms and continue to simmer for another 30 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  If you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk in the flour during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaf before serving.


**2. Prepare the Creamy Polenta:**

* Bring water and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in polenta, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, for 20-25 minutes, or until the polenta is thick and creamy.
* Stir in heavy cream and butter until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Stir in Parmesan cheese before serving.


**3. Serve:**

* Spoon the creamy polenta onto plates and top with the Beef Bourguignon. Garnish with fresh parsley or chives, if desired.  Serve immediately and enjoy!


**Chef's Notes:**

* For a richer flavor, you can brown the beef in batches to ensure it browns properly and doesn’t steam.
* Feel free to add other vegetables to the Bourguignon, such as potatoes, turnips, or parsnips.  Add them along with the carrots and celery.
* If you don’t have coarse polenta, you can use fine polenta, but it will result in a slightly thinner consistency.
* Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Enjoy your delicious and sophisticated Beef Bourguignon!
